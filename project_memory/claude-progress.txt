END OF INITIALIZER AGENT LOG
=============================================================================

=============================================================================
Date: 2025-12-03
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Added 4H timeframe toggle for Swing Trading Framework
Changes:
- Added /api/swing-framework/current-state-4h using 4H RSI-MA data, 4H bin cohort stats, and fallback calculations (backend/swing_framework_api.py)
- Made CurrentMarketState timeframe-aware with cached daily/4H fetches, timeframe chip, and tooltip (frontend/src/components/TradingFramework/CurrentMarketState.tsx)
- Added Daily/4-Hour tabs to SwingTradingFramework to switch live state views without re-fetching cached data (frontend/src/components/TradingFramework/SwingTradingFramework.tsx)
Testing:
- Not run (yfinance-backed data fetch requires live data). Recommend: start backend, curl /api/swing-framework/current-state-4h, then run frontend npm dev and switch tabs to confirm both views render; run npm run build for TS check.
Next Actions:
- Validate 4H endpoint responses for SPY/QQQ/AMZN fallback stats.
- Confirm UI tab switching retains sorting preferences and refresh intervals for both timeframes.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later same day)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Fixed missing 4H cohort stats causing empty table
Changes:
- compute_4h_cohort_stats_from_data now builds per-cohort stats (extreme_low through extreme_high) and cohort_all for fallback (backend/swing_framework_api.py)
Testing:
- Not run (needs live data). Re-test /api/swing-framework/current-state-4h then reload frontend 4H tab.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later same day)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Added 4H data fetch fallback to avoid empty tables when 4H data is unavailable
Changes:
- current-state-4h now falls back to daily data when 4H fetch fails but still uses 4H bins when present, ensuring rows render (backend/swing_framework_api.py)
Testing:
- Not run. Re-run backend, hit /api/swing-framework/current-state-4h, and refresh the 4H tab; confirm rows appear even if yfinance 4H fetch fails.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later same day)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Added final fallback to daily cohort cache for 4H endpoint
Changes:
- current-state-4h now pulls daily cohort cache if both 4H bins and 4H fetch fail, so frontend always receives cohort data and rows render (backend/swing_framework_api.py)
Testing:
- Not run. Restart backend, curl /api/swing-framework/current-state-4h, ensure market_state has rows, then refresh frontend 4H tab.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Implemented backend duration-in-low-percentile analysis + API surface
Changes:
- Added swing_duration_analysis module to compute per-trade time-in-low-zone, escape timing, time-to-first-profit, and winner/loser comparisons with heuristics for ticker bounce profile (backend/swing_duration_analysis.py)
- Exposed GET /api/swing-duration/{ticker}?threshold=5.0 to return duration metrics with defensive error handling (backend/api.py)
Testing:
- Not run (yfinance fetch requires network). To verify: start backend, curl http://localhost:8000/api/swing-duration/NVDA?threshold=5.0 and inspect winners/losers/per_threshold fields; run pytest if needed once sample data available.
Next Actions:
- Validate endpoint output for multiple tickers and thresholds, tune thresholds_to_track if needed, and wire frontend SwingDurationPanel to display duration metrics.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Added Swing Duration UI and integrated toggle
Changes:
- Created SwingDurationPanel to fetch /api/swing-duration/{ticker}, show winner/loser duration metrics, per-threshold patience table, and bounce profile (frontend/src/components/TradingFramework/SwingDurationPanel.tsx)
- Added view toggle in SwingTradingFramework with Duration Analysis tab wiring the panel and reusing selected ticker (frontend/src/components/TradingFramework/SwingTradingFramework.tsx)
Testing:
- Not run (backend data fetch requires yfinance). To validate: start backend, curl /api/swing-duration/NVDA?threshold=5.0, then run frontend dev server and open Duration Analysis tab; adjust threshold slider and ticker select to confirm data renders.
Next Actions:
- Verify endpoint responses across tickers, refine UI formatting if any fields are null, and add a focused Jest test for SwingDurationPanel once mock data available.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Fixed CORS config for duration endpoint
Changes:
- Made allowed origins configurable via ALLOWED_ORIGINS env and disabled credentials when wildcard is used to ensure Access-Control-Allow-Origin is set (backend/api.py)
Testing:
- Not run. Restart backend with `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://<frontend-host>` (or leave default '*' for dev without credentials) and re-hit the duration endpoint from the frontend.
Next Actions:
- Restart backend and confirm requests from the frontend host succeed without CORS errors.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Expanded CORS for Codespaces
Changes:
- Updated CORS to accept wildcard with regex for *.app.github.dev and disabled credentials to ensure Access-Control-Allow-Origin is emitted in Codespaces (backend/api.py)
Testing:
- Not run. Restart backend and retry from the Codespaces frontend URL.
Next Actions:
- Confirm CORS now passes from https://friendly-space-...-3000.app.github.dev to the backend.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Added sample-data fallback toggle for duration endpoint
Changes:
- Duration analysis now retries with sample data when live fetch returns empty and supports use_sample_data query param to force the fallback (backend/swing_duration_analysis.py, backend/api.py)
Testing:
- Not run. Restart backend; in dev without network, call /api/swing-duration/NVDA?threshold=5&use_sample_data=true to bypass yfinance and unblock UI.
Next Actions:
- Restart backend, retest duration endpoint from the frontend, and switch use_sample_data on if live data is blocked.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Fixed JSON serialization for duration endpoint
Changes:
- Sanitized duration raw event payload to convert numpy types/bools to native Python for FastAPI response encoding (backend/swing_duration_analysis.py)
Testing:
- Not run. After backend restart, retry /api/swing-duration/{ticker}?threshold=5 (add use_sample_data=true if needed).
Next Actions:
- Verify endpoint now returns 200 and CORS headers, then reload Duration Analysis tab.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Clarified data source handling for duration endpoint
Changes:
- Removed implicit sample fallback; duration analysis now uses live data by default and only falls back when use_sample_data=true, and exposes metadata.data_source to show whether live or sample data was used (backend/swing_duration_analysis.py)
Testing:
- Not run. After backend restart, call /api/swing-duration/{ticker}?threshold=5 (add use_sample_data=true only if you want sample data) and inspect metadata.data_source.
Next Actions:
- Confirm responses show data_source=live when using real data and sample only when explicitly requested.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Fixed per-threshold stats lookup and key normalization
Changes:
- Normalized per-threshold keys to avoid “5.0”/“5” mismatches and adjusted frontend lookup so per-threshold patience table populates (backend/swing_duration_analysis.py, frontend/src/components/TradingFramework/SwingDurationPanel.tsx)
Testing:
- Not run. After backend restart, refresh Duration Analysis tab; per-threshold rows should now show sample counts and values.
Next Actions:
- Re-verify GOOGL/AMZN tables and confirm non-null per-threshold metrics with live data.
