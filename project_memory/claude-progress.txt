Framework: FastAPI
Core Files:
  - api.py (450 lines) - REST endpoints
  - enhanced_backtester.py (830 lines) - D1-D21 backtesting
  - monte_carlo_simulator.py (400 lines) - Forward simulations
Key Dependencies:
  - FastAPI 0.104.1
  - pandas 2.1.3
  - numpy 1.26.2
  - yfinance 0.2.32
  - scipy 1.11.4
Status: MVP Complete, Testing Framework Needed

FRONTEND STRUCTURE
------------------
Language: TypeScript/React
Build Tool: Vite 5.0
Core Components:
  - PerformanceMatrixHeatmap.tsx
  - ReturnDistributionChart.tsx
  - OptimalExitPanel.tsx
  - TradingFramework/ (comprehensive trading dashboard)
  - GammaScanner/ (gamma exposure analysis)
Key Dependencies:
  - React 18.2
  - Material-UI 5.14
  - Plotly.js 2.27
  - TanStack Query 5.8
Status: MVP Complete, Testing Framework Configured

CURRENT PROJECT STATE
=====================

Phase: Phase 1 Complete - MVP Fully Functional

What Works:
✓ Backend API operational with 8+ endpoints
✓ D1-D21 backtesting engine functional
✓ Monte Carlo simulation engine implemented
✓ Interactive frontend dashboard deployed
✓ Performance matrix heatmaps rendering
✓ Return distribution charts working
✓ Optimal exit recommendations calculating
✓ Docker deployment ready

What Needs Work:
✗ Backend test suite (pytest framework in place, no tests written)
✗ Frontend test suite (Jest configured, no tests written)
✗ Integration tests between backend and frontend
✗ API endpoint validation tests
✗ Component unit tests
✗ E2E user flow tests

Technical Debt:
- Test coverage is 0% (frameworks configured but no tests)
- No CI/CD pipeline implemented
- Some documentation gaps in newer components
- Performance optimization opportunities (caching, lazy loading)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FIRST CODING AGENT
=======================================

PRIORITY 1: Create Backend Test Suite
--------------------------------------
Focus: Write comprehensive pytest tests for backend API

Target Files:
  - tests/test_api.py (API endpoint tests)
  - tests/test_backtester.py (backtesting logic tests)
  - tests/test_monte_carlo.py (simulation tests)
  - tests/test_statistical_analysis.py (stats tests)

Why This First:
  - Backend is core foundation of the application
  - API stability is critical for frontend functionality
  - Tests will catch regressions as features are added
  - Provides confidence for future modifications

Success Criteria:
  - 80%+ backend code coverage
  - All API endpoints have test coverage
  - Core algorithms (RSI, percentile, returns) validated
  - Edge cases and error conditions tested

Estimated Effort: 4-6 hours

PRIORITY 2: Create Frontend Test Suite
---------------------------------------
Focus: Write Jest/React Testing Library tests

Target Files:
  - tests/components/PerformanceMatrixHeatmap.test.tsx
  - tests/components/ReturnDistributionChart.test.tsx
  - tests/components/OptimalExitPanel.test.tsx
  - tests/api/client.test.ts (API client tests)

Why This Second:
  - Ensures UI components render correctly
  - Validates user interactions
  - Catches TypeScript type issues
  - Provides regression protection for UI

Success Criteria:
  - 70%+ frontend code coverage
  - All major components have tests
  - User interactions tested (clicks, hovers)
  - API client mocked and tested

Estimated Effort: 3-5 hours

PRIORITY 3: Integration Tests
------------------------------
Focus: End-to-end testing of backend + frontend

Why This Third:
  - Validates complete user flows
  - Tests API contract between backend/frontend
  - Catches integration issues

Success Criteria:
  - Critical paths tested (load ticker, run backtest, view results)
  - API responses validated against TypeScript types
  - Error handling verified

Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours

NOTES FOR CODING AGENT

END OF INITIALIZER AGENT LOG
=============================================================================

=============================================================================
Date: 2025-12-03
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Added 4H timeframe toggle for Swing Trading Framework
Changes:
- Added /api/swing-framework/current-state-4h using 4H RSI-MA data, 4H bin cohort stats, and fallback calculations (backend/swing_framework_api.py)
- Made CurrentMarketState timeframe-aware with cached daily/4H fetches, timeframe chip, and tooltip (frontend/src/components/TradingFramework/CurrentMarketState.tsx)
- Added Daily/4-Hour tabs to SwingTradingFramework to switch live state views without re-fetching cached data (frontend/src/components/TradingFramework/SwingTradingFramework.tsx)
Testing:
- Not run (yfinance-backed data fetch requires live data). Recommend: start backend, curl /api/swing-framework/current-state-4h, then run frontend npm dev and switch tabs to confirm both views render; run npm run build for TS check.
Next Actions:
- Validate 4H endpoint responses for SPY/QQQ/AMZN fallback stats.
- Confirm UI tab switching retains sorting preferences and refresh intervals for both timeframes.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later same day)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Fixed missing 4H cohort stats causing empty table
Changes:
- compute_4h_cohort_stats_from_data now builds per-cohort stats (extreme_low through extreme_high) and cohort_all for fallback (backend/swing_framework_api.py)
Testing:
- Not run (needs live data). Re-test /api/swing-framework/current-state-4h then reload frontend 4H tab.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later same day)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Added 4H data fetch fallback to avoid empty tables when 4H data is unavailable
Changes:
- current-state-4h now falls back to daily data when 4H fetch fails but still uses 4H bins when present, ensuring rows render (backend/swing_framework_api.py)
Testing:
- Not run. Re-run backend, hit /api/swing-framework/current-state-4h, and refresh the 4H tab; confirm rows appear even if yfinance 4H fetch fails.

Date: 2025-12-03 (later same day)
Agent: Coding Agent
Activity: Added final fallback to daily cohort cache for 4H endpoint
Changes:
- current-state-4h now pulls daily cohort cache if both 4H bins and 4H fetch fail, so frontend always receives cohort data and rows render (backend/swing_framework_api.py)
Testing:
- Not run. Restart backend, curl /api/swing-framework/current-state-4h, ensure market_state has rows, then refresh frontend 4H tab.
