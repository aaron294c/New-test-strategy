### Daily is MORE Overbought
The daily RSI-MA (61.05) is showing MORE strength/overbought conditions than the 4H RSI-MA (48.76).

### Interpretation: "Daily Overextended"
This is a **bearish divergence** pattern where:
1. The daily timeframe has run up significantly (68.65th percentile)
2. The 4H timeframe is NOT confirming this strength (only 30.95th percentile)
3. The 4H is lagging behind, showing weakness

### Signal: Reversal Likely
When the daily gets ahead of the 4H like this, it typically signals:
- The daily move is **overextended**
- The 4H is showing **early weakness**
- A pullback/reversal is **likely**

## Why This Is NOT Inverted

- Daily RSI-MA (61.05) is relatively **high** for GOOGL → 68.65th percentile ✓
- 4H RSI-MA (48.76) is relatively **low** for GOOGL → 30.95th percentile ✓

## Trading Action

Based on mean reversion principles:
- **Current Signal**: BEARISH DIVERGENCE - TAKE PROFIT OR SHORT
- **Category**: Daily Overextended (Daily high, 4H low)
