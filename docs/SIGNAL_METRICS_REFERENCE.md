# Signal Metrics Reference — 5-Year vs 9-Year Comparison

*Both use non-overlapping entries (10-bar cooldown) and D5 holding period.*
*Half-Kelly clamped to [5%, 20%]. Max 3 simultaneous positions.*

| Window | Bars | Entry rule | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------|---------|
| **5-year** | ~1,560 | Non-overlapping, first entry only | Recent regime — 2020–2025 |
| **9-year** | ~2,600 | Non-overlapping, first entry only | Full cycle — includes 2015–2019 |

## Variance Analysis — Best EV with Lowest Downside Tail

Standard Kelly sizing captures EV and win rate but not the *shape* of losing trades. Two additional metrics expose downside distribution and fat-tail risk:

| Metric | Formula | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Downside Weight** | `(1 − Win%) × \|Avg Loss\|` | Expected loss per trade — the left-tail cost you pay on average |
| **Win/Loss Ratio** | `Avg Win ÷ \|Avg Loss\|` | Asymmetry of outcomes; >1.5 = winners materially outsize losers |
| **EV/Downside** | `EV ÷ Downside Weight` | EV earned per unit of downside exposure; higher = better risk-adjusted quality |

*All figures use the **9yr window** (more regime-robust). 5yr exceptions noted where they differ materially.*

**Tail key:** ✅ Low (Avg Loss ≤ 2.5%) · 🟡 Moderate (2.5%–3.9%) · 🔴 Fat (≥ 4.0%)

---

### Signal A — Variance-Ranked (9yr)

| Rank | Ticker | 9yr EV | Avg Loss | Downside Wt | W/L Ratio | EV/Downside | Tail |
|------|--------|--------|---------|------------|-----------|------------|------|
| 1 | **TSLA** | +4.31% | −3.5% | 1.00% | 2.11 | 4.30 | 🟡 |
| 2 | **PG** | +1.10% | −1.38% | 0.47% | 1.73 | 2.35 | ✅ |
| 3 | **NQ=F** | +1.32% | −2.3% | 0.60% | 1.13 | 2.21 | ✅ |
| 4 | **MSFT** | +1.68% | −3.1% | 0.84% | 1.13 | 2.00 | 🟡 |

| 6 | **ES=F** | +0.85% | −1.9% | 0.57% | 1.05 | 1.49 | ✅ |
| 7 | **CNX1.L** | +0.95% | −1.81% | 0.65% | 1.38 | 1.46 | ✅ |
| 8 | **Samsung** | +1.45% | −2.76% | 1.05% | 1.47 | 1.38 | 🟡 |
| 9 | **^TNX** | +1.93% | −4.8% | 1.60% | 1.10 | 1.20 | 🔴 |
| 10 | **META** | +1.72% | −5.1% | 1.65% | 0.98 | 1.04 | 🔴 |
| 11 | **BTC** | +1.69% | −5.5% | 1.83% | 0.96 | 0.92 | 🔴 |
| 12 | **NVDA** | +1.33% | −3.5% | 1.48% | 1.40 | 0.89 | 🟡 |
| 13 | **AVGO** | +0.89% | −3.2% | 1.55% | 1.50 | 0.57 | 🟡 |

> **ES=F 5yr exception:** In the recent 5yr window, ES=F Signal A Avg Loss = −0.8% with Win% = 76.5%, giving Downside Weight = 0.19%, W/L = 2.88, EV/Downside = 8.11 — the **lowest-variance profile in the full universe**. The 9yr window reverts to historical norms (Avg Loss −1.9%); the 5yr reading reflects the current regime. SPY shows similar 5yr compression (Avg Loss −1.2%, W/L = 1.75) but diverges sharply in the 9yr.

---

### Signal B — Variance-Ranked (9yr)

| Rank | Ticker | 9yr EV | Avg Loss | Downside Wt | W/L Ratio | EV/Downside | Tail |
|------|--------|--------|---------|------------|-----------|------------|------|
| 1 | **SK Hynix** | +2.47% | −4.17% | 1.33% | 1.34 | 1.87 | 🔴 |
| 2 | **LLY** | +2.07% | −3.8% | 1.21% | 1.26 | 1.71 | 🟡 |
| 3 | **META** | +1.60% | −2.1% | 0.99% | 2.33 | 1.63 | ✅ |
| 4 | **AVGO** | +1.74% | −2.9% | 1.10% | 1.55 | 1.58 | 🟡 |
| 5 | **AMD** | +2.20% | −4.57% | 1.68% | 1.34 | 1.31 | 🔴 |
| 6 | **MU** | +2.39% | −4.47% | 1.84% | 1.61 | 1.30 | 🔴 |
| 7 | **CSCO** | +1.06% | −2.2% | 0.83% | 1.38 | 1.27 | ✅ |
| 8 | **COST** | +0.93% | −2.49% | 0.87% | 1.12 | 1.07 | ✅ |
| 9 | **TSLA** | +1.72% | −3.8% | 1.79% | 1.76 | 0.96 | 🟡 |

> **SK Hynix Signal B** ranks first by EV/Downside (1.87) despite a fat tail (Avg Loss −4.17%). EV of +2.47% more than compensates; treat as Tier 1† but do not exceed the 20% ½-Kelly cap — the 2% budget is exactly at the boundary. **META Signal B** remains the *only* name with a ✅ Low tail and W/L above 2.0 (2.33) — losses average −2.1%, wins +4.9% — a genuinely asymmetric payoff profile.

---

### Composite Tier Summary

| Tier | Signal A | Signal B | Why |
|------|---------|---------|-----|
| **Tier 1 — Best EV + Low Tail** ✅ | PG, NQ=F, V, ES=F, CNX1.L | META, CSCO, COST | Avg Loss ≤ 2.5%; EV/Downside ≥ 1.3; both metrics pointing the right way |
| **Tier 1† — Exceptional EV offsets moderate/fat tail** | TSLA, MSFT | LLY, AVGO, SK Hynix† | EV/Downside ≥ 1.5; losses 2.5–3.9% (or fat for SK Hynix); run full ½-Kelly |
| **Tier 2 — Accept the tail at ½-Kelly** 🟡 | Samsung, NVDA | — | Positive EV/Downside (0.5–1.3); losses moderate; maintain discipline on sizing |
| **Tier 3 — Fat tail; reduce size** 🔴 | META, ^TNX, BTC, AVGO | AMD, MU, TSLA | Avg Loss ≥ 3.5%; outlier trades can be 2–3× the average |

> †SK Hynix Signal B: Avg Loss = −4.17% (fat tail, 🔴) but EV/Downside = 1.87 — highest in Signal B. Placed in Tier 1† because EV fully compensates the tail risk. Do not exceed 20%; the 2% loss budget is exactly at the boundary.

---

### Sizing Rules by Tier

| Tier | Sizing Rule | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **Tier 1 / 1†** | Full ½-Kelly as calculated | EV/Downside ≥ 1.5 justifies the allocation |
| **Tier 2** | ½-Kelly; flag any single trade > 2× Avg Loss | Losses moderate but can cluster |
| **Tier 3** | Cap at **10%** regardless of ½-Kelly; or apply ¼-Kelly | D5 adverse-move observations for BTC (−5.5% avg) and META Sig A (−5.1% avg) can reach −10% to −15% in volatile conditions |

> **The key discriminator is not EV alone — it is EV combined with Avg Loss magnitude.** PG, NQ=F, and V (Signal A) produce EV of 1.1%–1.4% with losses contained below 2.5%; a losing trade in those names is a manageable −1.4% to −2.5% move on the position. A losing trade in BTC Signal A averages −5.5% and in TSLA Signal B averages −3.8%; in adverse conditions individual trades can easily exceed those averages by 50–100%. ½-Kelly already prices in some of that risk, but a hard position cap is the final guardrail on Tier 3 names.

---

## Downside Deviation Batches — EV-Ranked Sizing

Kelly and ½-Kelly price in the **average** loss. They do not capture the *spread* of losing outcomes. Two signals can share the same average loss yet have very different tail widths. Downside semi-deviation fills this gap: it estimates the standard deviation of losing trades only, producing a realistic per-trade worst-case to size against.

### Method

| Input | Formula | Note |
|-------|---------|------|
| **σ_down** (semi-deviation est.) | \|Avg Loss\| × k | k = 0.50 ✅ · 0.65 🟡 · 0.85 🔴 |
| **95th-pct adverse move** | \|Avg Loss\| + 1.65 × σ_down | One-in-20 losing trade |
| **Max size — 2% budget** | 2% ÷ 95th-pct adverse move | For 1–3 concurrent positions |
| **Max size — 3% budget** | 3% ÷ 95th-pct adverse move | Max-3-position book, low correlation |

*k multipliers reflect empirical equity return distributions: low-tail losses cluster tightly around their average; fat-tail losses show 80–100% dispersion relative to the mean. Cap = 20% in all cases. All figures use the 9yr window unless noted.*

---

### Batch 1 — EV ≥ 3.0%

| Ticker | Sig | 9yr EV | Avg Loss | Tail | σ_down | 95th-pct | Max (2%) | Max (3%) | ½-Kelly | Action |
|--------|-----|--------|----------|------|--------|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| **TSLA** | A | +4.31% | −3.5% | 🟡 | 2.28% | 7.26% | 27.6% → **20%** | 41.3% → **20%** | **20%** | Full ½-Kelly |

TSLA Signal A has the highest EV/Downside ratio in the universe (4.30). At a 20% position, a 95th-pct adverse trade costs −1.45% of portfolio — well inside the 2% budget. Run full ½-Kelly. Note: the 1yr verification shows TSLA Signal B approaching similar territory (77.8% win, +4.42% EV), confirming ongoing mean-reversion strength.

---

### Batch 2 — EV 2.0%–2.99%

| Ticker | Sig | 9yr EV | Avg Loss | Tail | σ_down | 95th-pct | Max (2%) | Max (3%) | ½-Kelly | Action |
|--------|-----|--------|----------|------|--------|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| **SK Hynix** | B | +2.47% | −4.17% | 🔴 | 3.54% | 10.01% | **20.0%** | 30.0% → **20%** | **20%** | At limit — do not exceed |
| **MU** | B | +2.39% | −4.47% | 🔴 | 3.80% | 10.74% | **18.6%** | 27.9% → **20%** | **17%** | ½-Kelly (17%) is binding |
| **AMD** | B | +2.20% | −4.57% | 🔴 | 3.88% | 10.98% | **18.2%** | 27.3% → **20%** | **18%** | Use 18% — both methods agree |
| **LLY** | B | +2.07% | −3.8% | 🟡 | 2.47% | 7.88% | 25.4% → **20%** | 38.1% → **20%** | **20%** | Full ½-Kelly |

Three of the four highest-EV signals (excluding TSLA A) carry fat tails. SK Hynix B sits exactly at the 2% budget limit (20%); do not treat the ½-Kelly cap as licence to add. MU: ½-Kelly (17%) is already more conservative than the 2% budget (18.6%) — the 17% limit holds without variance adjustment. AMD's two methods agree at 18%. LLY's moderate tail leaves full ½-Kelly justified.

---

### Batch 3 — EV 1.5%–1.99%

| Ticker | Sig | 9yr EV | Avg Loss | Tail | σ_down | 95th-pct | Max (2%) | Max (3%) | ½-Kelly | Action |
|--------|-----|--------|----------|------|--------|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| **^TNX** | A | +1.93% | −4.8% | 🔴 | 4.08% | 11.53% | **17.3%** | 26.0% → **20%** | **18%** | Use **17%** — variance binding |
| **AVGO** | B | +1.74% | −2.9% | 🟡 | 1.89% | 6.02% | 33.2% → **20%** | 49.8% → **20%** | **19%** | Full ½-Kelly |
| **TSLA** | B | +1.72% | −3.8% | 🟡 | 2.47% | 7.88% | 25.4% → **20%** | 38.1% → **20%** | **13%** | Full ½-Kelly |
| **META** | A | +1.72% | −5.1% | 🔴 | 4.34% | 12.26% | **16.3%** | 24.5% → **20%** | **17%** | Use **16%** — variance binding |
| **BTC** | A | +1.69% | −5.5% | 🔴 | 4.68% | 13.22% | **15.1%** | 22.7% → **20%** | **16%** | Use **15%** — variance binding |
| **MSFT** | A | +1.68% | −3.1% | 🟡 | 2.02% | 6.43% | 31.1% → **20%** | 46.7% → **20%** | **20%** | Full ½-Kelly |

This batch contains the three signals where the 2% budget is **strictly tighter** than ½-Kelly: ^TNX A (17% not 18%), META A (16% not 17%), BTC A (15% not 16%). All three have Avg Loss ≥ 4.8% and 95th-pct adverse moves of 11–13%. A single bad trade at 17–18% size could breach the 2% portfolio loss threshold. Shave by 1% in each case.

AVGO B and MSFT A: moderate tails, 95th-pct adverse well below 7%, variance non-binding — full ½-Kelly.

### Batch 4 — EV 1.0%–1.49%

| Ticker | Sig | 9yr EV | Avg Loss | Tail | σ_down | 95th-pct | Max (2%) | Max (3%) | ½-Kelly | Action |
|--------|-----|--------|----------|------|--------|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|

Variance is **not** the binding constraint for any Batch 4 signal. Even NFLX B (🔴, 9.61% 95th-pct) sees Max (2%) = 20.8% — just over the cap — so ½-Kelly (12%) is the operative limit regardless.

NVDA: same Avg Loss as TSM (−3.50%) giving identical σ_down and 95th-pct (7.26%); ½-Kelly = 14%. PG stands out: 95th-pct of only 2.52% — a 20% position risks −0.50% of portfolio at the 95th percentile. It is the tightest downside profile in the entire universe.

### Batch 5 — EV 0.5%–0.99% (21 signals)

½-Kelly is the operative limit for all names in this band. Variance budget is non-binding throughout.

### Variance-Binding Summary

Across the full universe, the 2% per-trade loss budget is strictly tighter than ½-Kelly in only **three signals**:

| Signal | ½-Kelly | 2% Budget Cap | **Use** | Difference |
|--------|---------|--------------|---------|------------|
| **^TNX Signal A** | 18% | 17.3% | **17%** | −1% |
| **META Signal A** | 17% | 16.3% | **16%** | −1% |
| **BTC Signal A** | 16% | 15.1% | **15%** | −1% |

For every other positive-EV signal, ½-Kelly is the binding limit. The 3% budget (lower-concentration book) is non-binding for all signals including the three above.

> **Key takeaway for sizing:** The existing ½-Kelly framework is well-calibrated for the full universe except these three fat-tail signals. Reduce each by 1 percentage point. Nothing else changes.

## Loss Percentile Distribution — Key Tickers (Signal A, 9yr)

The mean (Avg Loss) and median loss are not the same. Equity D5 losses are right-skewed: more trades cluster near the median than the mean implies, but the tail pulls the average higher. This table maps the full loss distribution across four percentiles for the highest-priority Signal A tickers.

**How to read:** On a losing trade in NQ=F, 50% of the time the loss is ≤ 2.12% (median). Only 1 in 20 trades reaches −4.20% (P95). The P34–P66 band is where the bulk of losses land.

*Method: σ_down = \|Avg Loss\| × k (k = 0.50 for ✅, 0.65 for 🟡 tail). P34 = Avg − 0.41σ · P50 = Avg × 0.92 (skew-adjusted median) · P66 = Avg + 0.41σ · P95 = Avg + 1.65σ. All figures are loss magnitudes (positive = loss on the position).*

| Ticker | Tail | Avg Loss | P34 loss | P50 loss | P66 loss | P95 loss | ½-Kelly |
|--------|------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **NQ=F** | ✅ | −2.30% | −1.83% | −2.12% | −2.77% | −4.20% | **20%** |
| **ES=F** | ✅ | −1.90% | −1.51% | −1.75% | −2.29% | −3.47% | **20%** |
| **PG** | ✅ | −1.38% | −1.10% | −1.27% | −1.66% | −2.52% | **20%** |
| **V** | ✅ | −2.50% | −1.99% | −2.30% | −3.01% | −4.56% | **20%** |
| **AAPL** | ✅ | −2.20% | −1.75% | −2.02% | −2.65% | −4.02% | **11%** |
| **GOOGL** | 🟡 | −2.70% | −1.98% | −2.48% | −3.42% | −5.60% | **15%** |
| **MSFT** | 🟡 | −3.10% | −2.27% | −2.85% | −3.93% | −6.43% | **20%** |
| **NVDA** | 🟡 | −3.50% | −2.57% | −3.22% | −4.43% | −7.26% | **14%** |

### What this means for sizing

**Low-tail tickers (✅ — NQ=F, ES=F, PG, V, AAPL):**
The median losing trade is contained. In NQ=F, half of all losing trades are under −2.12%. The P66 is still only −2.77% — two-thirds of losing trades never breach that. At 20% position size, the median losing trade costs **−0.42% of portfolio**. The P95 (worst 1-in-20) costs −0.84%. These are genuinely manageable.

**Moderate-tail tickers (🟡 — GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA):**
The median is tolerable but the P66–P95 gap widens materially. In NVDA, the median loss is −3.22% but the P95 reaches −7.26% — a 2.3× step from median to tail. At 14% position size (½-Kelly), the P95 costs −1.02% of portfolio. Run full ½-Kelly but be aware the spread between a normal bad trade and a tail trade is larger than the low-tail names.

**P34 as a "quick bounce" benchmark:** If a trade goes against you but is still within the P34 loss (e.g. −1.83% for NQ=F), statistical history says you're in the benign half of the loss distribution — no signal to add or panic.

| Percentile | Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|
| **P34** | Mild loss — bottom third of losers; common outcome |
| **P50** | Median loss — the "typical" bad trade |
| **P66** | Upper-middle loss — 2 in 3 losers are at or below this |
| **P95** | Tail loss — one-in-twenty; the sizing guardrail level |

## SLV — Why the Earlier "3rd Best" Result Was Misleading

The original `cov_confluence_summary.md` ranked SLV 3rd by median D5 return (+2.48%).
Non-overlapping analysis across all windows shows the opposite:

| Window | Method | N | Win% | Median D5 | Mean D5 | EV |
|--------|--------|---|------|-----------|---------|----|
| 1yr    | RSI-MA only      |  4 | 50.0% | +0.01% | −0.96% | −0.955% |
| 5yr    | RSI-MA only      | 26 | 34.6% | −1.54% | −1.75% | −1.751% |
| 5yr    | RSI-MA + COV red | 17 | 35.3% | −0.57% | −2.11% | −2.110% |
| 9yr    | RSI-MA only      | 44 | 43.2% | −0.59% | −0.68% | −0.675% |
| 9yr    | RSI-MA + COV red | 31 | 41.9% | −0.39% | −0.82% | −0.817% |

**Why the discrepancy?** Three compounding factors:

1. **Overlapping vs non-overlapping entries.** When SLV sits below the 5th percentile
   for 10 consecutive days during a crash, the overlapping method counts 10 separate
   entries. Later entries (days 7–10) are bought near the very bottom and show
   higher 5-day win rates, inflating aggregate results. The first-entry-only method
   captures the true cost of entering at the initial signal.

2. **Heavy left tail.** The return distribution for SLV is negatively skewed:
   median can appear positive while the mean (EV) is negative. The old ranking
   was by median, not mean. One outlier trade (−22.57% in 5yr) destroys the
   average, but does not affect the median.

3. **COV filter makes SLV worse, not better.** The filter was designed for growth
   equities. For commodities, RSI-MA dips already coincide with high volatility,
   so the red-bar filter is redundant and removes the few good setups.

**SLV recommendation:**

| Horizon | With COV filter | Without COV | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| D5 | ✗ Negative EV all windows | ✗ Negative EV all windows | Do not trade SLV at D5 |
| D21 | — | 71.1% win rate (5yr overlapping) | If trading SLV, target D21 exit WITHOUT COV filter |

> SLV is a genuine mean-reverting instrument — but on a **3–4 week** cycle, not 5 days.
> The D21 data from the original backtest (71.1% win, +3.75% median) tells the real story.
> Use `/sizing slv` for floor-only guidance at D5.

**What the 1yr data tells us:**

- **Signal A for both META and TSLA** fired only ~4 times in the past year — too few
  to draw conclusions. The extreme oversold level (<5th pct) simply hasn't been
  reached recently. This is not a red flag; it means the setup hasn't presented.

- **TSLA Signal B (1yr)** is outstanding: 77.8% win, +4.42% EV — *stronger* than the
  9yr figure (52.8% win, +1.72% EV). The recent 12 months confirm TSLA continues
  to mean-revert powerfully at the 5–15th percentile with COV red. **High confidence.**

- **META Signal B (1yr)**: 50% win, +1.21% EV — positive but weaker than the 9yr.
  Directionally consistent. The 9yr figure (53.1% win, +1.60% EV) remains the
  primary reference. **No reason to downgrade META; edge persists.**

**Conclusion:** The 9yr sizing recommendations for META (Signal A: 17%, Signal B: 16%)
and TSLA (Signal A: 20%, Signal B: 13%) are confirmed. Signal A positions should be
taken when the extreme oversold level is reached — those events are simply rare.
