# Signal Metrics Reference — 5-Year vs 9-Year Comparison

*Both use non-overlapping entries (10-bar cooldown) and D5 holding period.*
*Half-Kelly clamped to [5%, 20%]. Max 3 simultaneous positions.*

| Window | Bars | Entry rule | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------|---------|
| **5-year** | ~1,560 | Non-overlapping, first entry only | Recent regime — 2020–2025 |
| **9-year** | ~2,600 | Non-overlapping, first entry only | Full cycle — includes 2015–2019 |

> **How to read the Δ column:** Positive = 9yr half-Kelly is higher (signal more robust
> across regimes). Negative = 5yr half-Kelly is higher (recent conditions favour it more).

## SLV — Why the Earlier "3rd Best" Result Was Misleading

The original `cov_confluence_summary.md` ranked SLV 3rd by median D5 return (+2.48%).
Non-overlapping analysis across all windows shows the opposite:

| Window | Method | N | Win% | Median D5 | Mean D5 | EV |
|--------|--------|---|------|-----------|---------|----|
| 1yr    | RSI-MA only      |  4 | 50.0% | +0.01% | −0.96% | −0.955% |
| 5yr    | RSI-MA only      | 26 | 34.6% | −1.54% | −1.75% | −1.751% |
| 5yr    | RSI-MA + COV red | 17 | 35.3% | −0.57% | −2.11% | −2.110% |
| 9yr    | RSI-MA only      | 44 | 43.2% | −0.59% | −0.68% | −0.675% |
| 9yr    | RSI-MA + COV red | 31 | 41.9% | −0.39% | −0.82% | −0.817% |

**Why the discrepancy?** Three compounding factors:

1. **Overlapping vs non-overlapping entries.** When SLV sits below the 5th percentile
   for 10 consecutive days during a crash, the overlapping method counts 10 separate
   entries. Later entries (days 7–10) are bought near the very bottom and show
   higher 5-day win rates, inflating aggregate results. The first-entry-only method
   captures the true cost of entering at the initial signal.

2. **Heavy left tail.** The return distribution for SLV is negatively skewed:
   median can appear positive while the mean (EV) is negative. The old ranking
   was by median, not mean. One outlier trade (−22.57% in 5yr) destroys the
   average, but does not affect the median.

3. **COV filter makes SLV worse, not better.** The filter was designed for growth
   equities. For commodities, RSI-MA dips already coincide with high volatility,
   so the red-bar filter is redundant and removes the few good setups.

**SLV recommendation:**

| Horizon | With COV filter | Without COV | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| D5 | ✗ Negative EV all windows | ✗ Negative EV all windows | Do not trade SLV at D5 |
| D21 | — | 71.1% win rate (5yr overlapping) | If trading SLV, target D21 exit WITHOUT COV filter |

> SLV is a genuine mean-reverting instrument — but on a **3–4 week** cycle, not 5 days.
> The D21 data from the original backtest (71.1% win, +3.75% median) tells the real story.
> Use `/sizing slv` for floor-only guidance at D5.

## META and TSLA — 1-Year (252 Trading Days) Verification

The 9yr non-overlapping data showed both META and TSLA are *stronger* over the full
decade than the 5yr window. This 1yr check tests whether the edge holds in the
most recent conditions.

| Ticker | Signal | 1yr N | Win% | Avg Win | Avg Loss | EV | ½K | Verdict |
|--------|--------|-------|------|---------|----------|----|----|---------|
| META   | A (<5th + COV) | 4 | — | — | — | — | — | **Too few events** — signal barely fired |
| META   | B (5–15th + COV) | 8 | 50.0% | +4.28% | −1.86% | +1.21% | **14%** | ⭐⭐ Positive |
| TSLA   | A (<5th + COV) | 4 | — | — | — | — | — | **Too few events** — signal barely fired |
| TSLA   | B (5–15th + COV) | 9 | 77.8% | +6.73% | −3.68% | +4.42% | **20%** (solo **30%**) | ⭐⭐⭐ Outstanding |

**What the 1yr data tells us:**

- **Signal A for both META and TSLA** fired only ~4 times in the past year — too few
  to draw conclusions. The extreme oversold level (<5th pct) simply hasn't been
  reached recently. This is not a red flag; it means the setup hasn't presented.

- **TSLA Signal B (1yr)** is outstanding: 77.8% win, +4.42% EV — *stronger* than the
  9yr figure (52.8% win, +1.72% EV). The recent 12 months confirm TSLA continues
  to mean-revert powerfully at the 5–15th percentile with COV red. **High confidence.**

- **META Signal B (1yr)**: 50% win, +1.21% EV — positive but weaker than the 9yr.
  Directionally consistent. The 9yr figure (53.1% win, +1.60% EV) remains the
  primary reference. **No reason to downgrade META; edge persists.**

**Conclusion:** The 9yr sizing recommendations for META (Signal A: 17%, Signal B: 16%)
and TSLA (Signal A: 20%, Signal B: 13%) are confirmed. Signal A positions should be
taken when the extreme oversold level is reached — those events are simply rare.
